# Deep Learning Experiments

Practices of deep learning applications I applied in my master's thesis and personal projects are demonstrated here.

## Projects

### Savannah
Outlines the basic workflow for satellite image analysis:
1. Extraction of endmembers from the satellite sensor
2. Synthetic training data creation
3. Application of 1D CNN model to generate prediction maps

### FNN (Feedforward Neural Network)
A different type of neural network approach designed to estimate multiple consumer markets:
- Uses synthetic training data
- Incorporates feature engineering to create dense, information-rich datasets
- Optimized for improved model performance

## 2026 Goals

- [ ] Add experiments folder and understand, calculate, interpret the model architecture
- [ ] Add notes from the book 'Why Machines Learn'
