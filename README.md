Practices of deep learning applications I applied in my master’s thesis and personal projects are demonstrated here. Savannah folder outlines the basic workflow, beginning with the extraction of endmembers from the satellite sensor, followed by synthetic training data creation and the application of 1D CNN model to generate a prediction map.FNN folder includes a different type of neural network approach, designed to estimate multiple consumer markets. This approach may use synthetic training data and incorporates feature engineering to create a dense, information-rich dataset for improved model performance.

2026:
- add experiments folder and understand, calculate, interpret the model architecture and interpret
